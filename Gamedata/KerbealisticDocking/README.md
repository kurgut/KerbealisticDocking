KerbealisticDocking

This mod is a simple patch applied to all docking ports, modded or not, that lowers the "crazy magnet" force attracting docking ports towards each other.
It also change other value related to ModuleDockingNode, such as acquirerange, etc.
It makes docking harder in a way, since you need to be more precise, but also avoid the bumpiness experienced upon docking due to the magnets forces.
It is inspired by Realism Overhaul configs, which are modified, credit goes to them for doing this in the first place.
